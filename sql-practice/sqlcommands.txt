Dropping a table 
  drop table if exists <table name>;

Lesson 1 - Creating tables
create table users (
id serial,
age int,
first_name text,
last_name text,
email text
);


Lesson 2 - Data types 
types are essentially a way of defining a data type within a column
Ex: 
int - used to store integer
varchar - like a string value in golang 
serial  - integer that auto increments
text - a column that is like a type string
uuid - not auto incrementing. universally unique identifier 

Lesson 3 - Constraints
Constraints are rules that you can apply to fields in a table 

Ex:
Primary Key - value cannot be null example an id SERIAL PRIMARY Key
UNIQUE - every single entry in the dB needs a unique value for a field ex: email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL 
NOT NULL this ensures every record for a field has a value ex: email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL email will not be null, usually provided with UNIQUE
