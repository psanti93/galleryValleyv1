goose has a tool called 'goose fix' that will version out your migration files

````
2023-01-01_some_migration.sql
2023-01-03_paul.sql <-- say I submit my sql file days after john's this can cause an issue as far as versioning
2023-01-02_john.sql 
`````

goose fix will append some sort of version prefix to distinguish between each file version
````
00001_some_migration.sql
00002_paul.sql
00003_john.sql
